# Todo-react-app
This is the simple web app using create-react-app.create-react-app is a much easier way which does all the configuration and necessary package installations for us automatically and starts a new React app locally, ready for development.

## How to Install Create-React-App:
In order to install your app, first go to your workspace (desktop or a folder) and run the following command:
 `npx create-react-app my-app`
The installation process may take a few minutes. After it is done, you should see a folder that appears in your workspace with the name you gave to your app.

## How to Run the App You Created with Create-React-App:
After the installation is completed, change to the directory where your app was installed:
`cd my-app`
and finally run `npm start` to see your app live on localhost
